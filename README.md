# Day_2_Continuation

6. Question mentions about the real numbers. But implementation is fine.
7. Multi catch - if you remember, I spoke about this -- we never catch NullPointerException. Need to change this.
Other two are fine.
8. Program is correct, but need to demonstrate with other type as well.
9. Implementation seems on correct track, but left incomplete?
